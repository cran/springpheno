\title{
Damage Index Calculator
}
\description{
This function calculates the damage index (Schwarz et al. 2006, Schwarz et al. 2013) given the first leaf index (FLI) and day of year for the last spring freeze. This is based on the calculation done in the original Matlab code base (Ault et al. 2015).
}
\usage{
damageindex(leafidx, lastfreeze)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{leafidx}{
Scalar - FLI value from the leafindex function. It's recommended to use the average, but one could also use the FLI for the individual plants.
}
  \item{lastfreeze}{
Scalar - day of year of the last spring freeze.
}
}

\value{
The output is a scalar with the value of the damage index. The damage index is effectively the difference between the FLI and the last freeze. Negative values are converted to zero as no damage occurs if the last freeze is before the first leaf.
